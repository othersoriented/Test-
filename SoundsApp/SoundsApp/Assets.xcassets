The file "SoundsApp/SoundsApp/Assets.xcassets" is not a code file, but a collection of assets used in the app. It's a folder that contains images and sounds used in the app. It's not possible to generate code for this file. However, you would add your image and sound files to this folder in the Xcode project. The names of these files should match the names used in the SoundModel.swift and ViewController.swift files.
